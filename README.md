# utfpr_tictactoe
A variation of the Tic Tac Toe game

In this version of the Tic-tac-toe game we have:
- 3 players, with symbols X, O and +
- a 4x4 board
- a player can put a symbol over the symbols of other players
  - But there is a no-revenge rule. If, in the last  play, X put his symbol over O. In the next O play, it cannot put his symbol over X.
